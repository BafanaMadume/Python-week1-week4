## PCEP - CERTIFIED ENTRY LEVEL PYTHON PROGRAMMER (Exam PCEP -30-0x)

# 1.ENTRY LEVEL PYTHON PROGRAMMER CERTIFICATION
**PCEP certification** is a professional credential that evaluates your python programming skills
* it tests your knowledge of **fundamental programming concepts**,**python synatax and semantics** and ability to tackle common coding challenhges using python standard library
* Being PCEP certified mean one understands thr basics of computer programming and have a good understanding of python's language features and runtime environment.

## Certification Curriculum and objectives
### 1. Introduction to python and computer programming

* we need to understaand how a computer actually works and how programs are executed on it.we also need to know how programming languages are defiend and built
* important to differentiate between **Compilation** and **interpretation** ,these are two different ways of turning code into something the computer understand
  
### 2. Data types,variables ,basic input-output operations,basic operators
it provides ways to format and display data ,we have different type of data like **number** , **strings** and **operators** for doing calculations
* you can use variables to store data and there are conventions for naming variables
* you can assign values to variables using assignment operator
* expressions in python follow specific rules,where you can also input and conert dat a in python

### 3. Boolean Values,conditional execution,loops,list,logical and bitwise operations
* We have boolean values that come handy when you want to compare stuff and decide which way to go in your code,using the if and if-else statement.Loops like while and for loops are useful for repeating actions  and their behaviour an be controlled using the break and continue statement
* Difference between logical and bitwise operations and lists,the like containers tht hold multiple values and can be used to iterating through them using a for loop and slicing them .
* understanding the concept of multi dimensional arrays which are like arrays with arrays

### 4. Functions,Tuples,Dictinaries and Data processing
Idea of functions .why we use them anf how they work ,Different ways to pass arguments and set default values .ow functions give back results;the challenges of name scope;and wo new types of data collections tuples and dictionaries and how they handling data

# Associate in Python Programming Certification
**PCAP certification ** fouses on object oriented programming and covers advanced programming aspects like OOP essentials ,modules and packages ,handlking exceptions in OOP,string operations,list comprehensions,lambdas,genrators,closures amd file handling 
*  PCAP Certification (Exam PCAP-31-0x) is a valuable credential that assesses intermediate-level coding proficiency in python.it evaluates ability to design,develop,debug,execute and refactor multi-module python programs.also measure the skills in analyzing and modeling real life problems using OOP concepts and techniques
*  PCAP™ certification, individuals demonstrate familiarity with modules, packages, and PIP, character encoding, string processing, generators, iterators, closures, files, file streams, file processing, exception hierarchies and classes, selected Standard Library modules, and the fundamentals of OOP

## Cerification Curriculum and Objectives
### 1. Modules,packages and PIP
This covers the process of importing and utilizing python modules,as well as highlights some of the handy python standard library modules,covers the construction and utilization of python packages,it mentions PIP(python installation package) and its functionality in installing and uninstalling pre-made packages from PyPI.

### 2. Strings ,string and list Methods,Exceptions
We have characters,strings and coding standards,When it comes to manipulating lists, there are various methods available. Similarly, strings have their own set of methods for operations like searching and modifying,s. To control the flow of errors, we can use the handy try and except statements. They allow us to catch and handle exceptions gracefully. Speaking of exceptions, they have a hierarchy that determines which one gets caught first

### 3. Object-Oriented Programming
* It examines the fundamental ideas of OOP and highlights the contrasts bewtween procedural and object oriented approaches ,discussins their motivations and benefits
* It introduces key concepts such as classes, objects, properties, and methods. It also touches on the importance of designing classes that can be reused and the process of creating objects.
* it mentiond two important concepts in OOP:**inheritance and polymorphism**which allow for code reuse and flexibility. Finally, it briefly mentions how exceptions are treated as objects in OOP, providing a more structured and organized way to handle errors

### 4. Miscellaneous 
covers various topics in Python programming, such as generators, iterators, closures, and working with file systems and directories. It also mentions specific modules from the Python Standard Library, namely os, datetime, time, and calendar. These topics are essential for understanding and using Python effectively. 
* Generators, for instance, are functions that can be paused and resumed, allowing for efficient memory usage when working with large datasets
*  Iterators provide a way to access elements one by one from a collection
*  closures are functions that remember their enclosing scope even when executed elsewhere
*   As for working with file systems, it involves tasks like navigating directories, manipulating files, and retrieving information about them.
*    Python Standard Library modules provide useful functions for handling operating system interfaces, dates, times, and calendars. Mastering these concepts and modules can greatly enhance one's Python programming skills and open up a world of possibilities for building powerful applications.
